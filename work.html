        <p class="kilo">For this branding project I chose the company called Go Trip Holidays which is a travel agency. Go Trip Holidays is a small travel agency in Ottawa, the target audience for this company is people who like travel to other countries and seek more unusual places and experience. They are interested in discovering and experiencing the unspoiled natural environment. From this point, I did the whole branding for them.  </p>

          improve work efficiency.</p>
